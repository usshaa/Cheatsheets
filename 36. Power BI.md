Power BI Cheatsheet
Power BI is a powerful business analytics tool that allows you to visualize data, share insights across your organization, or embed them in an app or website. This cheatsheet covers essential Power BI concepts and features to help you get started quickly.
________________________________________
ðŸ”¹ 1. Power BI Basics
â€¢	Power BI Desktop: A free application that you install on your PC to create reports and data visualizations.
â€¢	Power BI Service: An online service (SaaS) for sharing and collaborating on reports and dashboards.
â€¢	Power BI Mobile: An app to access and interact with reports and dashboards on mobile devices.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Getting Data
You can import data from various sources in Power BI, such as Excel, SQL Server, Web, SharePoint, Google Analytics, and others.
Importing Data:
1.	Open Power BI Desktop.
2.	Click on Home -> Get Data.
3.	Select your data source (e.g., Excel, CSV, Database, Web).
4.	Load data into Power BI.
Common Data Sources:
â€¢	Excel: Import data from an Excel file.
â€¢	SQL Server: Connect to a SQL database.
â€¢	Web: Use web scraping or APIs to load data from websites.
â€¢	Text/CSV: Load data from text or CSV files.
________________________________________
ðŸ”¹ 3. Transform Data Using Power Query
Power BI uses Power Query Editor for data transformation. You can clean and transform data before loading it into Power BI for analysis.
Common Power Query Operations:
â€¢	Remove Columns: Right-click on the column header and choose "Remove."
â€¢	Filter Rows: Use filters to exclude or include specific rows.
â€¢	Merge Queries: Combine two tables based on a shared column.
â€¢	Pivot/Unpivot Columns: Reshape the data by converting rows to columns and vice versa.
â€¢	Split Column: Split a column into multiple columns (e.g., splitting full names into first and last names).
To open Power Query Editor, go to Home -> Transform Data.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Creating Relationships
Power BI allows you to create relationships between tables (like in a database) to enable easier analysis across different datasets.
Steps to Create a Relationship:
1.	Go to the Model view.
2.	Drag and drop fields to create relationships between tables.
3.	Power BI automatically detects relationships if there are common fields.
Types of Relationships:
â€¢	One-to-Many: One record in one table relates to multiple records in another table.
â€¢	Many-to-Many: Multiple records in one table relate to multiple records in another table.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Creating Visualizations
Power BI provides a variety of visualizations for data analysis.
Basic Visualizations:
â€¢	Bar Chart: Useful for comparing data across categories.
â€¢	Line Chart: Ideal for showing trends over time.
â€¢	Pie Chart: Displays proportions of a whole.
â€¢	Tree Map: Visualizes hierarchical data in nested rectangles.
â€¢	Cards: Show key metrics in a single box.
â€¢	Table: Displays data in a tabular format.
â€¢	Map: Geographic data visualizations.
â€¢	Gauge: Displays a single metric in a dial-like format.
Adding a Visualization:
1.	Select the visualization type from the Visualizations pane.
2.	Drag fields into the Values, Axis, and Legend fields.
3.	Customize your chart using the Format pane.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Slicing and Dicing with Filters
You can filter your data at various levels using slicers and filters.
Types of Filters:
â€¢	Visual Level Filters: Apply filters to individual visualizations.
â€¢	Page Level Filters: Apply filters to all visualizations on the current report page.
â€¢	Report Level Filters: Apply filters to all visualizations across the entire report.
Slicer:
â€¢	A Slicer is a visual filter. You can drag a field into a slicer and use it to filter other visualizations interactively.
________________________________________
ðŸ”¹ 7. Creating Calculated Columns and Measures
You can create custom columns and measures to perform calculations within your report.
Calculated Column:
A calculated column is a new column added to a table based on existing columns. It is calculated row by row.
New Column = Table[Column1] + Table[Column2]
Measure:
A measure is a calculation that is evaluated at the aggregation level of the report, typically used in aggregation functions like SUM, AVERAGE, or COUNT.
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Amount])
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):
DAX is a powerful formula language for creating calculated columns and measures. Key DAX functions include:
â€¢	SUM(), AVERAGE(), MIN(), MAX()
â€¢	IF(), SWITCH()
â€¢	CALCULATE() for modifying context
â€¢	DATEADD(), TODAY(), YEAR(), etc.

ðŸ”¹ 8. Creating Dashboards and Reports
Steps to Create a Report:
1.	Add visualizations (charts, tables) to the canvas.
2.	Arrange the visualizations for clarity and design.
3.	Use filters and slicers to allow for interactivity.
4.	Save the report by clicking File -> Save.
Publishing Reports:
1.	Click Home -> Publish.
2.	Choose a workspace in Power BI Service where the report will be published.
3.	Share the published report with others by providing a link or embedding it.

ðŸ”¹ 9. Power BI Service Features
The Power BI Service allows you to share, collaborate, and view reports.
Sharing Reports:
â€¢	Share a link directly to the report.
â€¢	Use workspaces to collaborate with teams.
Creating Dashboards:
â€¢	A Dashboard is a collection of visualizations (tiles) pinned from reports. You can interact with them in a consolidated view.
Data Refresh:
â€¢	Schedule data refreshes for datasets in the service to keep your data up to date.
â€¢	Go to Datasets -> Settings to configure refresh schedules.

ðŸ”¹ 10. Power BI Mobile
You can view and interact with your Power BI reports and dashboards using the Power BI Mobile app on iOS or Android.
Features:
â€¢	View and explore reports and dashboards.
â€¢	Interact with slicers, filters, and drill-through actions.
â€¢	Share insights with others via the app.

ðŸ”¹ 11. Power BI Embedded
You can embed Power BI reports and dashboards into your own applications using Power BI Embedded. This feature is typically used for ISVs (Independent Software Vendors) to integrate analytics within their products.
Steps to Embed Power BI:
1.	Use Power BI API for embedding.
2.	Generate embed codes for reports or dashboards.
3.	Configure authentication (e.g., via Azure Active Directory).

ðŸ”¹ 12. Power BI Gateway
The Power BI Gateway allows you to securely transfer on-premises data to Power BI for use in cloud-based reports.
Types of Gateways:
â€¢	Personal Gateway: For individual use with limited functionality.
â€¢	Enterprise Gateway: For organizations to connect multiple data sources.

ðŸ”¹ 13. Power BI Tips and Best Practices
Best Practices for Report Design:
â€¢	Keep it simple: Avoid cluttering the report with too many visuals.
â€¢	Use colors strategically: Choose colors that are visually appealing and meaningful.
â€¢	Use clear labels: Label everything so that users understand the data.
â€¢	Optimize performance: Minimize data models and visuals to improve report loading time.
