üîπ 5. Building Visualizations
Basic Visualizations:
‚Ä¢	Bar Chart: Compare data across different categories.
‚Ä¢	Line Chart: Show trends over time.
‚Ä¢	Pie Chart: Display proportions of a whole.
‚Ä¢	Scatter Plot: Compare values of two measures.
‚Ä¢	Map: Display data geographically (requires geographical fields).
‚Ä¢	Heatmap: Show intensity through color.
How to Create a Basic Visualization:
1.	Drag a measure to the Rows shelf and a dimension to the Columns shelf.
2.	Tableau automatically selects the appropriate visualization type (e.g., bar chart).
3.	Customize the chart using the Marks Card (color, size, shape, label).
Advanced Visualizations:
‚Ä¢	Dual-Axis Chart: Combine two different visualizations on one chart.
‚Ä¢	Histograms: Analyze the distribution of a single measure.
‚Ä¢	Box Plot: Display statistical data distributions.

üîπ 6. Calculations
Types of Calculations:
1.	Calculated Fields: Custom fields that you can create to perform calculations within Tableau.
Example:
Profit Ratio = SUM([Profit]) / SUM([Sales])
2.	Table Calculations: Perform calculations at the level of detail of the visualization. Example: Running Total, Percent of Total, Moving Average.
3.	Level of Detail (LOD) Calculations: Specify the level of granularity for calculations.
o	Fixed: Calculation at a fixed level of detail.
o	Include: Add more dimensions to the calculation.
o	Exclude: Remove dimensions from the calculation.
Example:
{FIXED [Region]: SUM([Sales])}

üîπ 7. Filters and Sorting
Filters:
‚Ä¢	Dimension Filters: Filter by specific categories (e.g., Region, Category).
‚Ä¢	Measure Filters: Filter by the range of numeric values (e.g., Sales > 100).
‚Ä¢	Top N Filters: Display only the top or bottom N records based on a measure (e.g., Top 10 Products by Sales).

o	Filter Actions: Filter data in one visualization based on selection in another.
o	Highlight Actions: Highlight related data across visualizations.
o	URL Actions: Link to external websites.
Stories:
‚Ä¢	A Story is a sequence of visualizations that present a data-driven narrative. Each point in the story is a ‚Äúsheet‚Äù or a ‚Äúdashboard‚Äù.
